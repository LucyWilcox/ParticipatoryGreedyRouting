Lucy Wilcox's review of https://github.com/poosomooso/Gaygents/blob/master/reports/draft_final_report.ipynb 

Question:  What is your understanding of the experiment the team is replicating?  What question does it answer?  How clear is the team's explanation?

#### My understanding is that you are trying to determine if there are more interracial couples as a result on online dating. I don’t fully understand what question the original authors are answering. I think you could try to explain this more clearly.

Methodology: Do you understand the methodology?  Does it make sense for the question?  Are there limitations you see that the team did not address?

#### It seems like the model yields obvious results. It appears that you are saying that with an increased chance of interaction between different races they will be more likely to get married. Though this probably has an impact, I don’t feel like it’s compelling enough for a conclusion like this. 

#### Maybe it would help if the paper explained what compatibility means. If this is somehow impacted by race that might make help the question make more sense (anecdotal, but saying this because as someone in an interracial relationship I feel like there are distinct issues which prevent “identical personalities”, your definition of compatibility). Maybe your model you somehow speak to the reason there is an increased chance of interracial matching in online dating instead of just assuming it as true.

Results: Do you understand what the results are (not yet considering their interpretation)?  If they are presented graphically, are the visualizations effective?  Do all figures have labels on the axes and captions?

#### I don’t like all the code in your report, it’s hard to read and would be easier if you explained in writing what you were doing.

#### Right now you results appear to just be verification.  

Interpretation: Does the draft report interpret the results as an answer to the motivating question?  Does the argument hold water?

#### As mentioned above it might be helpful if you explained what compatibility is. I would be curious if you there is a factor in your model that’s not the number of races or percent change of interracial edge that impact your model.

Replication: Are the results in the report consistent with the results from the original paper?

#### They appear to be consistent and you have backed this up well, though I don’t understand the axis choice in Figure 3.

Extension: Does the report explain an extension to the original experiment clearly?  Is it a sensible extension in the sense that it has the potential to answer an interesting question that the original experiment did not answer?

#### The extension is not complete at this point. I personally feel the original model could use something to make it more compelling before addressing same-sex couples. It seems like you will just get the same result, that if there are more races and a higher chance of edges between races, then there will be more interracial relationships.

Progress: Is the team roughly where they should be at this point, with a replication that is substantially complete and an extension that is clearly defined and either complete or nearly so?

#### Replication is done. Extension is not completed and somewhat defined.

Presentation: Is the report written in clear, concise, correct language?  Is it consistent with the audience and goals of the report?  Does it violate any of the recommendations in my style guide?

#### Again, I don’t love the code being in the paper. Otherwise it looks good.

Mechanics: Is the report in the right directory with the right file name?  Is it formatted professionally in Markdown?  Does it include a meaningful title and the full names of the authors?  Is the bibliography in an acceptable style? 

#### Not sure if it’s supposed to be in an iPython notebook, but if that’s okay, then go with it. The title isn’t too informative, it only addresses your extension.
